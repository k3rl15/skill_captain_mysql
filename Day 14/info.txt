CPU Utilization of MySQL Server

Concept:

The CPU utilization of a MySQL server can increase for several reasons, including:
High traffic: When there is a sudden increase in traffic or a high number of concurrent connections to the MySQL server, it can lead to an increase in CPU utilization.
Complex queries: If the MySQL server is executing complex queries or queries that require a large amount of processing power, it can result in an increase in CPU utilization.
Poorly optimized queries: Poorly optimized queries can lead to excessive CPU usage, as the server may need to perform unnecessary calculations or access a large amount of data.
Lack of indexing: When tables in the MySQL database are not properly indexed, it can lead to slow query execution times and increased CPU usage.
Inefficient server configuration: If the MySQL server is not configured optimally for the workload it is handling, it can result in increased CPU utilization.

In general, any situation that increases the workload on the MySQL server can lead to an increase in CPU utilization. It is important to regularly monitor the CPU utilization 
of the server and identify any potential performance bottlenecks to ensure optimal performance.
