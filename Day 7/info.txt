Group by, Order by, Having

Concept:

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It allows you to perform calculations on a specific column or set of columns and
display the results in a summarized format.
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. You can sort by a single column or by multiple columns
in a specific order. It is often used with SELECT statements to retrieve data in a specific order.
The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition. It works similar to the WHERE clause, but is used with aggregate 
functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc. The HAVING clause filters the groups that match the specified condition, whereas the WHERE clause filters the individual rows.
