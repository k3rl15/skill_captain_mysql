Process list and Explain Commands

Concept:

The processlist command in MySQL is used to display a list of active threads (or processes) that are currently running on the MySQL server. This command is helpful in 
monitoring the server's activity and identifying any processes that may be causing performance issues.

When the processlist command is executed, it returns a table of information that includes the following columns:
Id: The unique identifier for the thread.
User: The MySQL user associated with the thread.
Host: The hostname or IP address of the client associated with the thread.
db: The name of the database associated with the thread.
Command: The type of command the thread is executing (e.g., Query, Sleep, Connect, etc.).
Time: The amount of time in seconds that the thread has been executing its current command.
State: The current state of the thread (e.g., Sending data, Copying to tmp table, Sorting result, etc.).
Info: The actual SQL query that the thread is executing.

By analyzing the information returned by the processlist command, a DBA or system administrator can identify processes that may be causing performance issues, such as 
long-running queries or queries that are using excessive resources. They can then take appropriate measures to optimize or terminate these processes to improve the overall 
performance of the MySQL server.

The EXPLAIN command in MySQL is used to provide information about how MySQL executes a query. When you execute the EXPLAIN command, MySQL returns a table of information 
that describes how the query will be executed, including the order in which tables are accessed, the indexes that are used, and how the data will be retrieved and joined. 
This information can be useful for optimizing queries and identifying potential performance issues. The EXPLAIN command is often used in conjunction with other MySQL 
commands, such as SELECT, to provide insight into how the database engine is working.
