Drop and Truncate

Concept:

The DROP statement is used to delete an entire table from the database. When you drop a table, all data and the table structure is permanently deleted. 
This means that you will not be able to retrieve the data after the table has been dropped.

The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the structure of the table intact. This means that you can still retrieve 
data from the table if you have previously backed up the data, or if you insert new data into the table. The TRUNCATE statement is much faster than the DELETE
statement for removing all data from a table.

Both the DROP and TRUNCATE statements should be used with caution, as they can result in permanent data loss.
