SELECT and WHERE

Concept:

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. This statement can either select specific columns from the table specified by table_name or 
all columns from a table if an asterisk (*) is used in place of the column names. It returns all rows from that table.

The WHERE clause is used to filter the results returned by a SELECT statement based on a specified condition. The condition is an expression that evaluates to true, 
false, or unknown. Rows that evaluate to true are returned by the SELECT statement, while rows that evaluate to false or unknown are filtered out. You can use comparison 
operators such as =, <, >, <=, >=, and <> to construct the condition.
