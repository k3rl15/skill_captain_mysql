Joins - Cross, Inner, Outer

Concept:

MySQL has several types of joins that allow you to combine data from two or more tables. The most commonly used ones are:
Cross Join: This type of join returns the Cartesian product of both tables. It combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table, resulting in a 
large number of rows.
Inner Join: This type of join returns only the matching rows from both tables based on the specified join condition. It excludes the non-matching rows from both tables.
Full Outer Join: This type of join returns all rows from both tables and NULL values for the non-matching rows in each table.
Left Outer Join: This type of join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table based on the specified join condition. If there are no matching 
rows in the right table, it returns NULL values.
Right Outer Join: This type of join returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table based on the specified join condition. If there are no matching 
rows in the left table, it returns NULL values.

The join type you choose depends on the relationship between the tables and the type of data you want to retrieve.
PS. Some databases do not support all forms of joins.
