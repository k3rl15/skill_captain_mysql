CREATE Statement and Data Types

Concept:

The CREATE statement is used to create a new database, table, view, index, or stored procedure. It is an essential command for defining the structure of a database 
and setting up the schema of a table.

To create a new database, you can use the following SQL statement:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Here, database_name is the name of the new database that you want to create.

To create a new table, you can use the following SQL statement:
CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, column3 datatype);
Here, table_name is the name of the new table that you want to create. The columns in the table are defined by their name and data type.

SQL data types can be broadly categorized into the following types:
Numeric data types: Used for storing numeric values such as integers, decimals, and floating-point numbers. Examples include INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL.
Character and string data types: Used for storing character strings such as names, addresses, and descriptions. Examples include CHAR, VARCHAR, and TEXT.
Date and time data types: Used for storing date, time, and timestamp values. Examples include DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP.
Boolean data types: Used for storing true/false values. Examples include BOOLEAN and BIT.
Binary data types: Used for storing binary data such as images, audio, and video files. Examples include BLOB and VARBINARY.
Miscellaneous data types: Used for storing other types of data such as XML, JSON, and arrays. Examples include XML, JSON, and ARRAY.

It's important to choose the appropriate data type for each column to ensure that the data is stored efficiently, and it can be queried and manipulated correctly.
